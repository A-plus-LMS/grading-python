----

Images are tagged with Python and grading-base versions in format `<python>-<grading-base>`.
Version tag can also include `uN` meaning _update N_ where N is an increasing number.
The update part is used to indicate updates to the image, where software versions did not change.
For an example, `3.5-2.0u1` includes Python 3.5 on top of grading-base 2.0 and has one update after first release.
